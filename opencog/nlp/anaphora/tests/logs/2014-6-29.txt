Summary:

15/24 tests passed(62.5%)

7 failed tests are due to missing or incorrect filters. This part can be easily fixed.

2 failed tests is due to unknown reasons, need to be investigated.

======================================================================================

Filters need to be added or fixed:

1. Sentences like:

   (1) Jane loved her. (Test #13)
   (2) Jane's mom loved her. (Test #4)

   These are special conditions in original Hobbs algorithm(non-reflexive must have intervening S/NP), currently this part
   has not been added. I think that a few filters will resolve these issues.

2. Incorrect gender filters need to be fixed:

   Failed tests(17,18,19) are due to bugs of gender filters, such as

   Alice always wanted a new boyfriend. Then he bumped into her, and she was enthralled.

   Result:

    (WordInstanceNode "she@e85b91ee-c644-46fa-89df-073f3cf4b22f") ; [5632]

    accepted Alice@f5e96c70-3e0e-43f3-9214-cefb8414bd2f

    (WordInstanceNode "she@90f508e0-3bac-436d-913a-e25d678cec27") ; [5602]

    accepted Alice@f5e96c70-3e0e-43f3-9214-cefb8414bd2f

    (WordInstanceNode "him@742f1a8e-3e40-40bc-970f-9ef2e677eaa1") ; [5614]

   Since "boyfriend" does not have a "masculine" tag on it and he is "masculine", "boyfriend" is rejected.

3. "neuter" anaphor should not refer to a person

   Failed tests(6,11) are due to this bug.

Needs investigations on tests(20,12)

Test #20

Jane looked at the boxes and the cup. It was small.

Test #12

Jane looked at the plates and the cup.They were ugly.

It seemed that the hobbs mind agent didn't do any resolution on these sentences.
They both have "and" in it.

1. Encountered an _nn antecedent problem.
   i.e. How should I handle a noun phrase like "air forces". (Test #26)
   Currently, only "forces" is only identified as first antecedent.

   Tree structure of "air forces"

             forces
             /
         _nn/
           /
         Air

   A simple solution which may work:

   Suppose current antecedent is 'A' and the parsing tree:

                   A
                 /
             _nn/
               /
              B
             /
         _nn/
           /
          C
         /
 NON _nn/
       /
      D


 a path of 'A'-'B'-'C' should be glued
 For 'B' a path of 'B'-'C' should be glued.

Summary:

36/46 tests passed(78.2%)
======================================================================================

Tests (31,34,35,36) failed mysteriously.
These four tests should be passed.

======================================================================================
Update:

For the test #34, "households" was tagged as a pronoun, so "households" was filtered out as expected.
Test #34 also needs more filters to filter out numbers and symbols.

There are some serious tagging errors in the parsing results as well, such as:

(PartOfSpeechLink (stv 1.000000 1.000000)
  (WordInstanceNode "38.5@b13e52c0-9f9c-4305-a0be-bb306249009e") ; [13052]
  (DefinedLinguisticConceptNode "det") ; [13217]
) ; [13231]

(PartOfSpeechLink (stv 1.000000 1.000000)
  (WordInstanceNode "%@2f68f0db-bfbb-4285-88ef-c3f53bb053a7") ; [13058]
  (DefinedLinguisticConceptNode "noun") ; [13201]
) ; [13230]

======================================================================================
Update:

A number filter (#15) has been added.

======================================================================================
Update:

For the test #35, "stavropolitanus" was identified as an "adj" which caused it to be filtered out by the filter #1.
